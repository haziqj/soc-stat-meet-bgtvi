  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the quality of approximation? No theoretical results, just in practice it works well
    \item Specifically, good for finding mean estimates and good at finding overall structure features (such as number of hidden components)
    \item Posterior Covariance structure of parameters are distorted by definition. Reports of underestimating variance.
    \item Thus, higher order estimates may be poor
    \item Convergence is local, may oversimplify the true posterior and miss important modes
